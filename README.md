# GameJam
Very simple Tower Defense Game made in Unity in 2 days. Thanks to Tony Wu for collaboration.

Game consists of 5 levels with 5 different unique enemy types and four towers.

To Run the game, Unity is a prerequisite. Once the computer has Unity installed, create a new project and import all assets from the repo onto the project. Then proceed to use Unity to create an executable to run the game.
